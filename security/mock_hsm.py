"""
Mock HSM: exposes the same interface a real Hardware Security Module client
would (encrypt a PIN block, verify a MAC), backed by ordinary software keys
instead of tamper-resistant hardware.

This is a LEARNING STAND-IN ONLY. The encryption here (XOR with a derived
key) is not cryptographically secure -- a real HSM uses 3DES/AES and never
lets the key leave dedicated hardware. Never use real PINs, real cards, or
this code anywhere near production.

Includes a simplified DUKPT-style key derivation: instead of one fixed key
used forever, each transaction gets its own key, derived from a shared base
key plus an incrementing counter (a stand-in for a Key Serial Number). Both
sides can independently re-derive the same per-transaction key from the
base key and the counter -- so a single leaked transaction key reveals
nothing about any other transaction.

        Three ways to get a base_key, in priority order:

        1. base_key passed explicitly -- used as-is. This is what every
           existing caller and test already does; behavior is unchanged.

        2. kms + persisted_key_path given -- the base_key is now genuinely
           persistent across restarts, which os.urandom() alone never was.
           On first run, a fresh key is generated via the KMS and its
           ENCRYPTED form is written to persisted_key_path (safe to store,
           since only the KMS's master key can ever decrypt it back). On
           every subsequent run, the encrypted key is read back and
           decrypted through the KMS -- the actual key material never
           touches disk in plaintext.

           os.urandom(16), regenerated fresh every process start. Fine for
           a single-process demo; anything encrypted under this key becomes
           permanently undecryptable the moment the process restarts,
