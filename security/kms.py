"""
Key management service, following the same swappable-interface pattern as
cache/idempotency_store.py and cache/velocity_tracker.py: one interface,
one fully real and tested implementation, one cloud implementation this
sandbox genuinely cannot reach (no network access to AWS/GCP's control
plane here -- the code is correct and matches boto3's real API shape, but
untestable without real credentials).

The core operation both real cloud KMS services (AWS KMS, Google Cloud
KMS) and this local version expose is envelope encryption:

  generate_data_key(key_id) -> (plaintext_dek, encrypted_dek)
      Generates a fresh AES data key. You get back the RAW key (use it
      immediately, then discard it from memory) and an ENCRYPTED copy,
      safe to store anywhere, since only the KMS holds the master key
      needed to ever decrypt it again.

  decrypt_data_key(encrypted_dek, key_id) -> plaintext_dek
      Asks the KMS to unwrap a previously-encrypted key back to plaintext.

This is the standard pattern real systems use to protect a long-lived
root/master key -- exactly the problem MockHSM's base_key had: it was
just os.urandom(), regenerated fresh every process start, meaning
anything encrypted before a restart became permanently undecryptable.
