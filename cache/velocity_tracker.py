"""
Velocity tracking, swappable the same way the idempotency store is.

The in-memory version is exactly what RiskEngine used to do internally --
extracted here so it can be swapped for the Redis version without
RiskEngine's own rules changing at all.

The Redis version uses a sorted set per card: ZADD records an attempt with
its timestamp as the score, ZREMRANGEBYSCORE prunes anything older than
the window, ZCARD counts what's left. This is the same sliding-window
algorithm the in-memory version runs -- just backed by a store every
replica shares, so an attacker spreading attempts across multiple pods
can't evade detection by hitting a different one each time.
