"""
Idempotency store, swappable between an in-memory dict (today's behavior,
zero setup, one process only) and Redis (safe across many replicas).

Both implementations fix a real race the original code had: the old
pattern was "check cache, process, then store result" -- three separate
steps. Two concurrent requests with the SAME brand-new idempotency key
could both pass the "not seen yet" check before either finished storing,
and both would get fully processed. That's the same category of race the
ledger's PRIMARY KEY on RRN was built to close -- this store closes the
equivalent race at the API layer, via an atomic claim step before any
processing happens at all.

claim() has three possible outcomes:
  - "new"        -- this caller won the race, proceed with processing
  - "duplicate"  -- already fully processed; here's the cached response
  - "mismatch"   -- same key, but a DIFFERENT request body -- reject, 400
  - "in_progress"-- another caller claimed it and hasn't finished yet
                    (a genuine, rare race -- the caller should NOT process
                    again; treat like a 409 and let the client retry)
