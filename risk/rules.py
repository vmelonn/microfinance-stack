"""
Risk layer: decides whether a transaction should be attempted at all,
before anything is sent over ISO 8583.

Runtime-order note: this runs BEFORE the security layer, message building,
or correlation -- it's a gate checked immediately when a request comes in,
not something bolted on after the fact. If this declines a transaction,
nothing below it in the stack (PIN encryption, message send, ledger) ever
runs.

Three signals, none of them certainty on their own:
  - velocity   -- too many attempts, too fast, on the same card
  - amount     -- unusually large, in absolute terms
  - entry mode -- DE 22 from Layer 1; manual key entry is inherently
                  riskier than a chip read, especially combined with a
                  larger amount

Each rule can escalate the outcome from approve -> review -> decline, and
the FINAL outcome is whichever rule pushed hardest, with every triggered
reason collected along the way.

Velocity tracking itself is NOT owned by this class anymore -- it's
injected as a VelocityTracker (see cache/velocity_tracker.py), so this
class doesn't need to know or care whether "how many recent attempts" is
answered by a local dict or a shared Redis store. Defaults to the
in-memory tracker so existing code that doesn't pass one keeps working
unchanged.
