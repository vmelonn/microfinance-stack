"""
Correlation layer: matches responses to the requests that caused them, using
the STAN (DE 11) that Layer 1 already puts in every message. Owns the
timeout -> reversal decision when a response never arrives.

This is the layer that lets everything above it pretend a transaction is a
simple synchronous call. send_and_wait() blocks and returns a result, even
though underneath, the actual exchange over the socket is fully
asynchronous and Layer 2 has no idea which response belongs to which
request -- that bookkeeping happens entirely here.
